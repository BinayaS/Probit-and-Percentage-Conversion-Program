NOTE:
This program is not optimized and can be slow.
This program does not yet use BigDecimals so it is prone to rounding errors on very small numbers.
It uses the data.txt file to make the table for finding probits from a percentage. 
Do not delete the data - Copy file as it is a backup of the data.txt.
I can not guarantee the accuracy of data generated by the user if you don't use the default/recommended settings.

THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES JAVA AND THE JAVA PATH TO BE SETUP BEFOREHAND

The StartProgram file will only work for windows
